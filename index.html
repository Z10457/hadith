                Before I state the 40 hadiths, it is important that one studies/reads these under a scholar/teacher so a person can understand them with the context. So, I have provided them below, by well known scholars and teachers (Shaykh Uthaymeen رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ (Died in 1420 A.H) being one of them, and the teacher Shaykh Saeed Hassan a well known teacher in the United Kingdom ):

                <span style = "color: rgba(126, 252, 0, 0.485);">one day when a man appeared with very white clothes and very black hair. There were no signs of travel on him and we did not recognize him. He sat down in front of the Prophet and rested his knees by his knees and placed his hands on his thighs. The man said, <span style = " color:yellow;">“O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.” </span>The Prophet said:
                    Islam is to testify there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish prayer, to give charity, to fast the month of Ramadan, and to perform pilgrimage to the House if a way is possible.
                    The man said, “You have spoken truthfully.” We were surprised that he asked him and then said he was truthful. He said,  <span style = " color:yellow;">“Tell me about faith.”</span> The Prophet said:
                    Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in providence, its good and its evil.
                    The man said, “You have spoken truthfully.  <span style = " color:yellow;">Tell me about excellence. </span>” The Prophet said:
                    Excellence is to worship Allah as if you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He surely sees you.
                    The man said,  <span style = " color:yellow;">“Tell me about the final hour.”</span>  The Prophet said: The one asked does not know more than the one asking.
                    The man said, “Tell me about its signs.” The Prophet said:The slave girl will give birth to her master and you will see barefoot, naked, and dependent shepherds compete in the construction tall buildings.
                    Then, the man left and I remained. The Prophet said to me: O Umar, do you know who he was? I said, “Allah and his messenger know best.” The Prophet said: </span>

By Allah, other than whom there is no God, one of you acts like the people of Paradise until he is but an arm’s length from it, and what is written overtakes him so he acts like the people of Hellfire and he enters it.

They said, “O Messenger of Allah, is there a reward for one who satisfies his passions?” The Prophet said: You see that if he were to satisfy his passions with the unlawful, it would be a burden of sin upon him? Likewise, if he were to satisfy himself with the lawful, he will have a reward.</span>
